# Learning to code Solidity and building this to keep me accountable and active. 

### Hey, you found this resource, hopefully it helps you on your Solidity journey. Feel free to comment regarding resources,help or any recommendations. Depending on time constraints ill try to update/reply where i can. 

### If your a Developer or Trader in Digital Assets feel free to add me [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rosshardingham/)

### My background comes from Finance and Banking, ive been trading crypto since 2017 and now working for a Crypto Fund as a DeFi Analyst and amongst researching projects also learning to code Python, JS and Solidity. 

### If you are totally new to coding and want to get started in Solidity you will need to create a [Github Account](https://github.com/) along with downloading a code editor or IDE. You have an option to just use [REMIX](https://remix.ethereum.org/) but we recommend [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it allows you to focus on many languages not just Solidity and it is the most popular amongst developers.
