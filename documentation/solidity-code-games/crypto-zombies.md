### Interactive Coding Lessons

In-browser step-by-step lessons take you from the very basics of Solidity to creating your own fully-functional blockchain-based game. Even by the end of Lesson 1 (which can be completed in one sitting), you'll know enough to officially call yourself a Blockchain developer!

### Build a Zombie Army

In Lesson 1, you will build a Zombie Factory to build your army. Every Zombie you create will have randomly generated DNA and have his own unique appearance. Further lessons (1 released each week) will add more functionality to your game, like the ability to battle other people's zombies!
