### Introduction

I'm a developer who's mostly been writing JavaScript, so the Solidity development environment was a bit hard to learn.

About four months ago, I switched to Hardhat from Truffle. This cool new kid on the block drastically improved my coding experience. So today I want to share it with my fellow Solidity developers.

In this post, I will walk you through the initial set-up, compilation, testing, debugging, and finally deployment.

At the end of this post, you will be able understand how to deploy an NFT contract to the local network with Hardhat.

The goal of this post is to make you familiar with Hardhat. I won’t talk about how to write a test or Solidity syntax. However, you should be able to follow along without any Solidity knowledge if you know how to write JavaScript.

See this repo for the code.

### Overview

1. How to Set Up the Project
2. How to Write and Compile the Contract
3. How to Test the Contract
4. How to Use console.log() in Hardhat
5. How to Deploy the Contract

### Conclusion

Hardhat has some other cool features like helpful stack trace, support for multiple Solidity compiler versions, a robust Mainnet forking, great TypeScript support and contract verification in Etherescan. But that’s for another time!
